### Description

This is a POS i am developing for a friend of mine. This is the Beta test release. It's fully functional except for the reporting and user management. POS fits fine for a small single shop. Simple DB functions are used gud to have a look into, and flex grid is used for data entry... with the old tricks, and the UI is pritty cool i think ;) .(updated with the ocx, it's names as HoverButton.oc_ , just rename it as .ocx b4 u open the project, hope it works this time, thanks for the support. really appriciate it guys.)
